# pdf-extracter
Python extracts annotation and the corresponding context of highlights from PDF scripts to make it easier to summarize the notes after reading the paper.Before for the convenience of the graph in the PDF annotation, when writing a paper is simply torture, simply wrote a script to improve efficiency.
Reference code from https://blog.csdn.net/jaytalent/article/details/112471396 |
Configuration：
pip install PyPDF2 |
pip install fitz |
pip install PyMuPDF==1.16.14
Maybe it is not very friendly to fresh coder. After finish writing my paper, I will improve the function and write a complete operation document. If you have any questions, you can leave a message or contact me at 369113823@qq.com.I wish you can obtain an early acceptance of your papers.



Python提取pdf中注释和高亮内容的脚本，方便阅读论文以后对注释进行汇总。以前为了图方便就在pdf标了注释，写论文的时候简直折磨，干脆写了个脚本提高效率。代码参考来自https://blog.csdn.net/jaytalent/article/details/112471396|
运行前配置：
pip install PyPDF2 |
pip install fitz |
pip install PyMuPDF==1.16.14
可能对小白不是很友好，等我论文写完了，完善一下功能，再写一个完整的操作文档出来吧，有疑问可以留言或者联系我的邮箱369113823@qq.com。祝大家论文早日录用
